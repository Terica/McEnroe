ALSTON1

Today I played Roger Alston, 76. He was nervous; and I found iot easy to captialize. But by the end of the match he was pciking most of my serves; dopwn the middle or occaisionally ripping one. The effectiveness of his return was concrete. I need to split step sooner, to allow a low return up the middel. When he is pickig my service. Just slow it down enough where we get deeoper in every game; every set. 

I relyed on my memory (after smoking heavily; amazing) while roger relies on muscle memory and keying on what to remember when. Shot selection. High tolerance for boredom; nothing boring about winning. 

Check and see how many side game I am playing with the ghosts of my mind. 

When i do the serve correctly it's unhittable.
