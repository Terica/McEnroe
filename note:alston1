ALSTON1

Today I played Roger Alston, 76. He was nervous; and I found it easy to captialize. He was picking most of my serves; dopwn the middle or occasionally ripping one. The effectiveness of his return was concrete. I need to split step sooner, to allow a low return up the middel. When he is pickig my service. Just slow it down enough where we get deeoper in every game; every set. 

I relyed on my memory (after smoking heavily; amazing) while roger is keying on what to remember when. Shot selection. High tolerance for boredom; nothing boring about winning. 

? How many side games my mind tries to insert. 

When i do the serve correctly it's unhittable.
