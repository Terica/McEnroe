THIS IS EXAMPLE OF RUBY FORUMS REFERRAL FOR CONTRACT WORK


Thank you very much for your interest in our project! I tried to send
you a private message but that led to an error.

The current version of the app is available at
https://todo-list-study.herokuapp.com 1 and the Github repository is
https://github.com/BrowenChen/Cognitive-Tools-for-Self-Mastery/ 2

The requirements for this project are

Set up a data base table, a route, an HTTP request, and a controller
method such that when a participants clicks Submit after having entered
text in one of the writing assignments, it is recorded in a data base
table along with the user id, the task id, and the submission time.

The form for the writing assignments is currently on an external
website (that I have control over). 

The form checks that responses are
at least 100 words long and displays a completion code only when this is
the case and otherwise informs the user to revise their response.

This
feature should be retained, but you are welcome to integrate the
external website into the Rails app.


Create a controller method and route that will allow the Admin user
to export the logged responses to the writing assignments to a JSON or
CSV file.


I have received responses from quite a few developers. To help me decide
whom to contract and write the contract, please send me the following
information:

A realistic estimate of number of working hours
A realistic estimate of total cost

A CV and contact information of one or more employers or clients who
can comment on your work with Ruby on Rails.

When would you be available to start working:
When would be the expected delivery date?

If we experience a problem with your code later on, will you be
available to fix it promptly?

If this project goes well, could I contract you again for adding
additional features at a later time?

Thank you very much!
