EVENTS: validates_presence_of :date, :time, :place, :notes
(SEE SCHEMA FOR ATTRIBUTES)

***************
:players
:opponents
:results
:game_plans
WHAT - Add the validates_presence_of to all the models. 
(Model.rb is the file where this goes)

*************
We are going to create tables that will associate with other tables:

Player has-many Opponents and GamePlans. 
I SURVEY myself; I SURVEY my Opponent. (this is instantiation)

WHAT
These need to be associated with each other through the rails console using model tables 

***************
(To win to use as directed)

***************

Player links are 
) :blank-game-plan
) :opponent - :name, :contact, :survey, :notes/journal/results/todos,. :last_event, :won_loss, :status, 
# how much data and logic need to exist in Opponent?

) :event # I'm not sure events are needed, as data. 


I think that game plans belong to opponents to always keep the starting context familiar:
  Player has_many Opponents
  —Opponents have past game_plans and new_game_plan.

******************************


Player has-many past and future Events.
—Events has :results :opponents :game_plans
Player has-many Results
Player has-many  Opponents;  Opponents have past game_plans and new_game_plan.
Events have new_opponents and Opponents; subbing to Gameplans
