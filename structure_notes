/model.rb

:players
:opponents
:results
:game_plans

WHAT AM I DOING? - Add the validates_presence_of to all the models.

*************

We are going to create tables that will associate with other tables:

Player has-many Opponents and GamePlans. 
I SURVEY myself; I SURVEY my Opponent. (this is instantiation)

WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN?
These need to be associated with each other through the rails console using model tables 

********************


I think that game plans belong to opponents to always keep the starting context familiar:
  Player has_many Opponents
  â€”Opponents have past game_plans and new_game_plan.

Player links are 
) :blank_game_plan
) :opponent_game_plan  :name, :contact, :survey, :notes/journal/results/todos... :last_event, :won_loss, :status, 

# how much data and logic need to exist in Opponent?
