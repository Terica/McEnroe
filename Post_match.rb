  Not seeing the ball. I use the fenceline(bottom) to orient my head still, while hitting through 3 balls at the earliest effective contact point. 

So today is a place to start. 
  I lost conditioning in the tiebreak 
  and started pooting volley over the net because 
  my contact point is not consistently true. 
    Goofy arm wiggles on BH bvolley because I forgot the U. 
    Hand under the ball. Racket under contact. 
    Hit through 3 balls. 
    Skip rope. 
    remember "IT'S COMING BACK!".

  Where is the late set stamina? Why do I think I can dominate at will? Lost that at will. Tired; to a Lombardi level. Really never want to forget how badly I was out to sea. I tried to walk it off; had to do swo repeatedly. Maui very nice and contrite. wanted to have good tennis. Bravo mister maui. Let him back in. Did not remember "IT'S COMING BACK!". Wilted and mentally quit before he hit one of my pootie volleys. I also hung back to watch, and other sins, of not marching right in. Back to the stamina drill.
